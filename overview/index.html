<h1>Web Development</h1>
<br>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<br>
To begin getting into web development, we must first understand the different systems that make it possible. These include three main programming languages that work in tandem to create a functioning webpage.<br>
<br>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<br>
HTML is the most important language for a webpage, as organizes all the text elements and containers, and tells the webpage where to find all of its files. Without an HTML file, there is no webpage.<br>
<br>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<br>
CSS, put simply, is what makes the site look pretty. CSS tells the website where to put everything and how it looks. It can also define the containers that HTML uses to organize things.<br>
<br>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<br>
JavaScript can be looked at as the logic behind a website. It does the more complex functions that CSS and HTML can't do. Think about things like button functions, moving navigation bars, and data manipulation.<br>
